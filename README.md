Daily cycle
===========
During the day, villagers will go to their workplace if they have one or hang around the town square if they don't.

Villagers that have a job will generate work items (e.g. food, wood, herbs).

At the end of the day, they will go the marketplace to buy items they need (e.g. food) or sell items they have created (e.g. wood).

When they have finished shopping at the market, they will travel to their house if they have one.

Villagers that have a job might get injured during the day. They will seek herbs at the market.

Villagers will slowly heal over time and will heal faster if they have a house.

Sales tax is collected each day and is paid into your TREASURY (see top left corner).

Villagers that have no food and no money will draw from the TREASURY so they don't starve. If the treasury is empty the villager might leave.
